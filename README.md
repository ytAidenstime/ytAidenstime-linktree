# 👋Welcome to the Linktree Open Source project👋

this project aims to provide a versatile Linktree that is open source and requires no 3rd party to use your data.
# 💰What is the benefit of Open Source?💰

the benefit of this being open source is that your linktree is fully hosted and managed by you and you have full rights to use it for what ever you wish.

# 🎨Is it customizable?🎨

yes this site is customizable and you choose what you want and what you do not want. we also provide 5 seperate layouts along with 5 seperate themes/color palletes. And if you know css and html you may also design your own custom theme yourself

# ❗Requirements❗
The requirements for this site are as follows

1. Hosting hardware some options are: VPS, Web Hosting (CPanel, Direct Admin), or any other server/computer with linux on it (it will work on windows but its not recommended and you have to figure that out on your own) NOTE: for the Web Hosting Panels it will not typically support Nodejs which means if you are using the Contact Form or the news letter/mailing list system it will not work. and i will not show you how to use cpanel for setting up a nodejs app on cpanel (because its not very reliable).

2. you have atleast some basic knowledge on how webservers and the internet works. (we do require a manual installation of this site so you will not be getting a one step installation script for various reasons).

3. the supported webservers are Appache and Nginx nothing else has been tested so use at your own risk.

4. the database used for Linktree is Mysql and we do not at this moment support MongoDB or any other Database. (the database can be ignored if you are not using the mailing list)

5. A domain. (this is required so that the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) works properly and effectively) NOTE: I 100% recommend you use SSL and its highly recommended you do use SSL yourself too.
