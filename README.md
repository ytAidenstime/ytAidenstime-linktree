# 👋Welcome to the Linktree Open Source project👋

this project aims to provide a versatile Linktree that is open source and requires no 3rd party to use your data.
# What is the benefit of Open Source?

the benefit of this being open source is that your linktree is fully hosted and managed by you and you have full rights to use it for what ever you wish.
